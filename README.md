# Munich Accident Forecasting

This repository contains a time series forecasting model developed to predict the number of traffic accidents in Munich, specifically focusing on alcohol-related incidents (`Alkoholunfälle`). The dataset used for this project is sourced from the München Open Data Portal and includes accident data up until the end of 2020.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to visualize the historical trends of traffic accidents in Munich and to forecast the number of accidents in the category `Alkoholunfälle` for January 2021. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, forecasting, and model evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset "Monatszahlen Verkehrsunfälle" was obtained from the München Open Data Portal. It includes monthly records of various types of traffic accidents from previous years.

## Features
- Data preprocessing to handle missing values and create a proper time index.
- Exploratory Data Analysis to visualize trends and patterns.
- Time series forecasting using machine learning techniques.
- Evaluation of the forecast accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
